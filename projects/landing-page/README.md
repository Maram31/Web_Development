## ProjectName
Egypt's Main Cities



## ProjectDescription
Learn all about Egypt's most important cities and the most popular centres for tourism. Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Aswan, Sharm El-Shiekh, and Hurghada are six places that should undoubtedly be including on any trip to the country.



## Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.



## Tools
Any text-editor of your choice will do. 



## Installation
No additional installation is required.
